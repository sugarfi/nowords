<h2>
an exploration of symbols, accessiblity, and communication
</h2>

<p>
language is common. im using it right now. most likely you will use it or have used it today. probably in the past few minutes,
even. it would not even be a stretch to say that  you probably interrupted some use of language, used some more language, and
then started using more language, all to read what im saying now.
</p>
<p>
language is a mechanism for communication. it often comes with several hurdles: grammar, language barrier, varying lexicons. these
impede the original goal of communication, in two ways: they make communication across languages hard, and then make it hard to
learn a new language, just by introducing a gigantic number of things one has to memorize.
</p>
<p>
symbols and emoji break down these barriers. almost everyone understands the meaning of a smile or an arrow pointing at something.
</p>
<p>
in this regard, language is a like a machine. a machine could simply be a box with a button and a screen. put a person in a room with
that machine, with no context or instructions, and chances are they will push the button and look to the screen, just because it
seems natural. a button, despite lacking any form of language, is communicating to a user, 'press me'. a screen, in the same way,
communicates 'look at me'.
</p>
<p>
there are two possible conclusions here: that machines represent a language in their own right, or that they can somehow transcend
language. i am going to go with both. lets extrapolate a bit, from machines to any form of multicultural object. a symbol, an animal,
a facial expression, a movement. an arrow pointing at something communicates, with no traditional language, 'look at this thing'.
a smile, 'i am happy'. a clap, 'i congratulate you'. taking it even further: somebody running communicates that they are trying to
get somewhere fast, be that place an office or the finish line. someone whistling as they walk signifies contentedness.
</p>
<p>

one could think of all these things as some form of cultural language. this can be specific to any culture. across the world, you'll
find different hand gestures and styles of dress and symbols. but a certain subset of these can reasonably be considered universal.
</p>
<p>

the good thing about these is that they are easy to understand. because they are universal (at least across a culture), if one can
assume that the listener is part of the culture of the language (which in most cases with the universal subset, one can), one can
assume their intent is communicated.

</p>
<p>
one might wonder: how can these symbols be changed? what would it take to alter a universal cultural language? the answer is a lot.
these symbols have developed over millenia and more recently through standards and ISOs. changing a cultural language for a small
group might be done, but even that might be hard.
</p>
<p>

now image using this cultural language not as some tool to supplement natlangs (as in emoji) or as some last resort, as often 
depicted in movies and whatnot. imagine it as a goto language, used by choice for people to communicate without learning any words
or anything. only pictures and symbols, arranged on a page.
</p>
<p>

there is one catch here: what about those who are blind, and use a screenreader? emoji are notoriously hard for those machines to
read. i propose an alternative solution: an associated sound with each character. to some extent, one can have a universal cultural
language of sounds: 'huh?' inflected communicates not understanding, regardless of language or culture. a certain grunt can probably
always be understood as unhappiness; another as disgust. and sometimes its just about volume: yelling communicates urgency, regardless
of what one says. another thing one can do: to indicate texture of an object, one can use the sound of it being hit on a table, for
example. a listener will be able to tell the difference between, say, breaking glass and rolling dice. and all this would be done
along with the pictures, so anyone could understand.
</p>
<p>

how could such a language, composed of a mixture of synchronous sound and pictures, be used effectively? it would be tedious to use
in 'normal' back and forth conversation, considering the time it would take to create a single sentence. i propose, then, that
this would be better done in a forum/asynchronous setting: a user would create a sentence, leave, allow others time to 'read' it
and interpret whatever devices they used. because that would be necessary: part of breaking down the llanguage barrier is removing
specific grammar and words. a user would have to work to make sure their sentence was understood,a nd it might be completely
different from another.
</p>
<p>

so what is this? this is my attempt to use an explore such a language. i will post a few sentences below; hopefully anyone reading
can understand them.
</p>
<p>

in short, this is no words.
